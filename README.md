# 🌿 Plant Disease Prediction App

A deep learning-based web application that predicts plant diseases from leaf images using a trained **CNN model** built with TensorFlow/Keras. The app is powered by **Streamlit** for an interactive user interface.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Upload a leaf image and get instant disease prediction
- Uses a pre-trained `.keras` model for inference
- Clean and interactive UI built with Streamlit
- Easy to extend with new datasets and models

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (model training & inference)
- **NumPy** (numerical operations)
- **Pillow** (image preprocessing)
- **Streamlit** (web app interface)

---


## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-disease-prediction.git
cd plant-disease-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app/app.py


## 📌 Future Improvements
- Add more plant species and disease classes
- Improve accuracy with transfer learning
- Deploy on cloud (Heroku, AWS, or Streamlit Cloud)
